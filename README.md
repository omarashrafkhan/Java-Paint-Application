Good day! 
This is my first mega Java project. It includes Layers functions and Bezier curve from photoshop. The rest is just basic paint application. hope you like it!


Shortcuts for new save and open: 'n', 's' ,'o'
Shortcuts for undo and redo: 'u','r'
You can also use keyUp and keyDown to move layer Up or Down


To use Bezier curve: click once to set start point move the mouse(before clicking again) and click again anywhere to select end point and then press and drag to change it into a quadratic
curve and finally press and drag to change it into cubic curve.


Note: Some icons may not load up due to file directory issue, so please check that out. File is used in: Shapetoolbar, Menubar and LayerBar
Also note that when you select and remove a layer they get renamed to maintain their position accordingly

Also make sure you have your taskbar set to float because some elements(Layer panel) take screen height into account, so they may not be visible with
the taskbar taking some space from below

Also note that if you have stroke zero and fill zero the shapes will still be drawn except for the bezier curve it wont be drawn if the stroke val is zero
